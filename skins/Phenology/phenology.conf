[Phenologies]

# Phenology is the study of seasonal biological development.  The
# progress of crops, weeds, and insect pests and beneficials can be
# quantified, based on prevailing weather.  Many models of development
# have been tested for various species of plants and animals.  Each
# gives a mathematical formula that is supposed to be linear with
# development.  These formulas use maximum and minimum daily
# temperatures as arguments, and most require threshold and cutoff
# temperatures as parameters to constrain growth outside ideal
# conditions.  All are used to predict growth due to the amount of
# heat present in the environment to speed development.  This is
# expressed as a product of temperature and time: Growing Degree-Days.
# As cumulative Growing Degree-Days increases throughout the season,
# milestones in development of each species are passed when biological
# treatments and controls may be enacted.  The needs of the past are
# observed, and the effort and material required to secure future
# crops are minimized by applying resources at optimal times.

# Phenologies of the following species are drawn from:

#   o University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources.
#     "Research Models: Insects, Mites, Diseases, Plants, and
#     Beneficials." 2014. 15 Apr. 2018
#     <http://ipm.ucanr.edu/MODELS/index.html>.

#   o Coop, Len. "Library of Degree-Day Models for Insects and
#     Plants."  11 Feb. 2007. Integrated Plant Protection Center,
#     Oregon State U. 12 Jan. 2019
#     <http://uspest.org/wea/wealib.html>.

# These are the specifications for various charts drawn by the
# *phenology* extension to the *WeeWX* weather reporting system.

# Charts are chosen by specifying the model of interest.  Most species
# have undergone extensive research around the country and several
# developmental models are in use for each one.  Choose a model that
# was developed near you if you can.

# Many models specify a "biofix," which is cumulative Growing
# Degree-Days at which some measurable event is observed to occur such
# as sustained insect trap counts.  The subsequent developmental
# stages (also in Growing Degree-Days) are not relative to the start
# date, but are relative to the biofix.  You will need to change your
# biofix Growing Degree-Days each year as soon as the event that you
# are waiting for actually occurs.  Then your charts will be relevant
# for the rest of that year.

# Other models specify a calendar start date at which Growing
# Degree-Days begin to accumulate.  Developmental stages in these
# models are therefore relative to zero Growing Degree-Days unless a
# biofix is provided, too.  Zero Growing Degree-Days begins on the
# chart start date, which is usually but not necessarily Jan, 1.

# All charts need a start date, so a start date of Jan, 1, is assumed
# if a start date is not made explicit by the model.

# If you live in the southern hemisphere, uncomment the following line:

# southern_hemisphere_start_month_offset = 6

# To reiterate: It is important that you choose models that have been
# validated for use close to your location.

# Most of the development stages are commented-out.  If you wish to
# see them on your chart, uncomment them.
