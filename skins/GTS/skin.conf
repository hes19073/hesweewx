[ImageGenerator]

    # be included in them, along with many plotting options. There is a default
    # for almost everything. Nevertheless, values for most options are included
    # to make it easy to see and understand the options.

    # Fonts can be anything accepted by the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which
    # includes truetype (.ttf), or PIL's own font format (.pil). See
    # http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagefont.htm for more
    # details.  Note that "font size" is only used with truetype (.ttf)
    # fonts. For others, font size is determined by the bit-mapped size,
    # usually encoded in the file name (e.g., courB010.pil). A relative path
    # for a font is relative to the SKIN_ROOT.  If a font cannot be found,
    # then a default font will be used.
